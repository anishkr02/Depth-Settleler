# Debt-Settle
Group Expense Splitter with Minimum-Transaction Settlement & UPI Deep-Links

## 1. Problem Statement

When a group of people share expenses over time — a hostel mess, a trip, a shared flat — money doesn't flow cleanly. Different people pay for different things at different times: one person pays for lunch, another for travel, another fronts cash for a small errand that gets partially spent. By the end of a period (a trip, a month of mess bills), nobody actually remembers who owes what, and if everyone tries to settle up individually — "you owe me for lunch, I owe you for travel, he owes you for the room" — you end up with far more transactions than necessary, several of which cancel each other out.

The core problem Debt-Settle solves:

> Given a group's shared expenses (who paid, how much, who it was for) and any informal person-to-person debts, calculate each member's net balance, and then determine the minimum number of payments needed to settle everyone up completely — with a one-tap UPI payment link generated for each payment.

This is not just a bookkeeping tool. The interesting part — and the part worth building well — is the settlement algorithm: turning a tangled web of who-owes-whom into the smallest possible set of actual transactions.

## 3. Core Features Built

- **Hybrid Settlement Engine**:
  - Automatically dispatches between an **Exact Backtracking Solver** (branch-and-bound DFS, guaranteed true minimum for $\le 12$ balances) and a **Greedy Heap Solver** ($O(n \log n)$ for $> 12$ balances).
- **One-Tap UPI Deep Links**: Generates native `upi://pay?pa=...&pn=...&am=...&cu=INR&tn=Settlement` URLs for instant payment via Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, and BHIM.
- **Identity & Dev Auth Bypass**: Server-derived identity with optional Firebase token verification and `DEV_MODE=true` header bypass (`X-Dev-Username`).
- **Flexible Expense Splits**:
  - Single-payer equal splits (`/expenses/equal`)
  - Multi-payer expenses (multiple people contributing to one cost)
  - Unequal splits: `exact` amounts, `percentage` (validates 100%), and `shares` (parts ratio) with penny-rounding drift correction.
- **Two-Step Confirmation Flow**:
  - Payer marks as paid $\rightarrow$ Status: `paid_pending_confirmation`.
  - Only the recipient can confirm or deny receipt $\rightarrow$ Status: `confirmed`.
  - Group is marked `fully_settled_at` once all transactions are confirmed.
- **Permanent Group Freeze & Safe Cancellation**:
  - Group is frozen from adding new expenses/debts as soon as a settlement plan is generated.
  - Admin can cancel settlement **only** if all transactions are still pending.
- **Group Chat with Auto-Lock**: REST-based shared group chat that automatically becomes read-only when the group is fully settled.
- **7-Day Retention Cleanup**: Cascade-deletes groups and all associated records 7 days after full settlement.
